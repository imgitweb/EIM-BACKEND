Using government weather data and satellite images, it calculates a simple Drought Score (0-100) for each district and sends early warnings when drought conditions develop. Instead of waiting weeks for field officers to verify drought, district officials, farmers, and insurance companies get instant, scientific drought status updates through an online dashboard. The platform helps save crops through early action, speeds up insurance claims from  days to 2 hours, and prevents losses by predicting drought risk before months in advance. Built using open-source technology and free government data by automation, making climate information accessible to everyone who needs it.",

The platform acts as a bridge between high-end technological advancements and the local farming community, transforming complex tools into accessible public utilities.\n\nCore Innovation:\nThe startup integrates three critical technology layers into a unified ecosystem:\n\nSatellite Intelligence: Provides real-time crop health monitoring and vegetation analysis directly to the farmer's device.\n\nPrecision Robotics: Establishes a seamless booking system for drone-based services, facilitating optimized nutrient and pesticide application.\n\nGovernment Integration: Syncs with state land records and family identification systems to verify beneficiaries and ensure services reach the rightful landholders.\n\nMission:\nThe primary goal is to shift agricultural technology from a high-cost commercial service to a sustainable government-led utility. By focusing on a \"nominal service fee\" model, the startup ensures that the most marginal farmers can leverage the same precision data used by large-scale enterprises.\n\nImpact:\nThrough this \"Setu\" (Bridge), the project enhances overall farm productivity, improves soil health through data-backed decisions, and streamlines the delivery of state subsidies, creating a transparent and technologically empowered rural economy.",

This creates transparency, saves time, and ensures fair pricing for both travelers and hotel partners.\n\nCurrently, Yuoom is generating revenue through curated tour packages while building a strong supply network of hotels, homestays, and hostels. Incubated at the Smart City Ujjain Incubation Center, Yuoom aims to scale into a smart, event-ready OTA platform designed for large spiritual gatherings and everyday travel alike.",

      "aboutStartup": "Cerebrogrammers is an enterprise-grade Agentic AI platform for automotive predictive maintenance that transforms reactive service models into proactive autonomous systems. Our startup approach addresses a critical pain point in India's automotive sector where 68% of vehicle breakdowns occur without warning costing the industry 8.5 crores annually per 10,000 vehicles. We leverage multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI framework where a Master Agent coordinates six specialized Worker Agents each with distinct roles goals and behavioral backstories. The Data Analysis Agent continuously ingests real-time telematics data from both ICE and EV vehicles monitoring parameters like engine temperature oil pressure battery state of health and brake wear against established thresholds. Upon anomaly detection the Diagnosis Agent employs predictive modeling using historical failure patterns and current sensor deviations to calculate failure probabilities time-to-failure estimates and repair cost projections with over 90% accuracy. The Customer Engagement Agent utilizes large language models specifically GPT-4 with temperature tuning for natural conversation generation to create personalized voice-based outreach scripts that employ empathetic communication and objection handling techniques achieving 75% booking conversion rates. The Scheduling Agent implements constraint satisfaction algorithms to optimize appointment allocation across service center capacity customer availability and parts inventory while the Feedback Agent conducts post-service sentiment analysis to generate CSAT scores. Our Manufacturing Insights Agent performs Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Preventive Action by aggregating failure patterns across vehicle fleets identifying recurring defects and generating actionable recommendations for production teams thereby closing the loop between field data and manufacturing quality improvement. We implement Zero Trust security architecture through User and Entity Behavior Analytics where a Guardian AI establishes behavioral baselines for each agent monitoring API call volumes data access patterns and temporal activity to detect anomalies in under 2 seconds with autonomous threat response including agent quarantine and access revocation. Our technical stack includes LangChain for LLM orchestration OpenAI API for natural language processing ElevenLabs for custom voice cloning React with Tailwind CSS for responsive frontend Node.js or Python Flask for RESTful API backend and real-time WebSocket connections for live dashboard updates. The system processes multi-modal data including structured sensor telemetry unstructured maintenance logs and conversational customer responses while maintaining sub-24-hour response times from prediction to customer contact. Our business model targets automotive OEMs and large fleet operators with SaaS pricing based on vehicle count offering 800% ROI through 65% reduction in unexpected breakdowns 35% decrease in warranty claims and 40% lower maintenance costs by shifting from emergency repairs averaging 12,000 rupees to preventive service at 4,800 rupees. The platform demonstrates horizontal scalability having been architected to handle concurrent monitoring of 50,000 plus vehicles with distributed agent processing and demonstrates vertical integration by connecting vehicle telematics through AI-driven service coordination to manufacturing quality feedback creating a complete closed-loop ecosystem. Our go-to-market strategy focuses on pilot deployments with tier-one OEMs in metro markets leveraging the 45 million connected vehicle installed base expected by 2025 and India's 23% EV adoption target by 2030 positioning Cerebrogrammers as critical infrastructure for the autonomous vehicle era where predictive maintenance becomes a competitive differentiator and revenue stream through data monetization partnerships with insurance providers and aftermarket service networks.Claude is AI and can make mistakes.

      "aboutStartup": "Grabily\n\nFor millions of students, graduates, and working professionals living away from home, daily food is a persistent problem. Cooking every day is unrealistic, local messes are unorganized and hard to discover, and food delivery apps like Zomato and Swiggy are built for occasional restaurant orders, not everyday meals. These platforms are expensive for daily use, inconsistent in quality, and operationally misaligned with the need for affordable, home-style food on a fixed routine.\n\nAt the same time, local mess providers already serve this demand offline, but they lack visibility, structure, subscription management, and digital trust. Everything runs on word of mouth, manual tracking, and informal payments, which creates friction for both users and mess owners.\n\nOur startup solves this gap by organizing local mess food into a subscription-based digital platform. Users can discover nearby messes, compare trial and monthly plans, and subscribe to fixed tiffin packages with predictable pricing and transparent meal tracking. Features like absence marking, pause notifications, and delivery confirmation bring reliability to daily food consumption. Mess owners get tools to manage subscribers, track deliveries, and earn stable recurring income without relying on third-party delivery logistics.\n\nUnlike Zomato or Swiggy, we do not compete on convenience food or impulse ordering. We focus on daily necessity, not discretionary spending. By avoiding platform-managed delivery and working directly with mess providers, the system stays cost-efficient, scalable, and sustainable.\n\nThe market opportunity is large and underexplored. Urban India has millions of students and professionals dependent on daily mess food, yet no dominant digital platform serves this segment effectively. With high retention, subscription-driven revenue, and locality-based scaling, this model is built for long-term adoption rather than short-term growth hacks.\n\nIn essence, we are transforming an unorganized offline necessity into a reliable, structured, and scalable digital service for everyday meals.",

It serves as a private, always-available space where young people can find immediate support, track their emotions, and build healthy habits without any judgment or stigma.\nAt the core of MindCare is an intelligent voice and chat AI bot that acts like a caring, understanding friend. Students can simply type or speak naturally about what they're feeling—whether it's exam anxiety, loneliness, low motivation, or just needing someone to listen—and the bot responds with empathy, gentle guidance, and practical suggestions to help them feel better in the moment.\nThe app also includes a simple mood tracker that lets users quickly check in with their emotions each day, choosing from feelings like happy, stressed, anxious, calm, or tired. Over time, it reveals personal mood patterns and offers soft insights, such as noticing that mood improves after journaling or listening to music, helping students become more aware of what affects their mental state.\nFor deeper reflection, MindCare provides a secure private journal where users can freely write about their thoughts, worries, or moments of gratitude. Guided prompts are available for days when it's hard to start writing, and all entries are safely stored so users can revisit their journal history to see their personal growth and progress.\nTo help with instant calm, the app offers guided breathing exercises and short relaxation sessions perfect for managing sudden stress or preparing for sleep. There's also a collection of soothing music and nature sounds, including lo-fi beats, focus tracks, and sleep playlists, allowing students to unwind or concentrate while studying.\nAdditional helpful features include quick self-assessment tools to gauge current stress levels, a dedicated help section with emergency contacts, coping tips, and positive affirmations, making it easy to find the right support at the right time.\nWith its calming green design and intuitive layout, MindCare feels welcoming and peaceful from the moment it's opened. It’s more than just an app—it's a daily companion that quietly supports students in taking care of their mental health, one conversation, one breath, one journal entry at a time, empowering them to face their student journey with greater balance, confidence, and emotional strength. 🧠💚",

      "aboutStartup": "Our startup idea, IRIS 2.0 (Intelligent Retinal Interpretation System), is an AI-powered multimodal assistive healthcare and navigation solution designed to empower visually impaired, deaf-blind, and speech-impaired individuals. The core vision of IRIS 2.0 is to enable independent living, safety, and confidence by bridging the gap between humans and their surroundings using AI, computer vision, and IoT-enabled wearables .\nIRIS 2.0 addresses critical real-world challenges such as navigation barriers, obstacle detection, emergency awareness, signboard reading, face recognition, and communication difficulties, which are commonly faced by visually impaired individuals. Unlike existing solutions that are either expensive or fully cloud-dependent, IRIS 2.0 introduces a hybrid intelligence architecture that works seamlessly in both online (cloud-assisted) and offline (edge-based) modes. This ensures real-time responses even in poor or no-network conditions, making it highly suitable for India’s rural and semi-urban environments.\nThe system integrates vision-based AI for object and obstacle detection, OCR for reading text and signboards, gesture and sign-language recognition, face detection and recognition, GPS-based navigation with voice and haptic feedback, and fall detection with SOS alerts. These features are delivered through a low-cost, multipurpose wearable device powered by on-device AI models and supported by cloud intelligence for enhanced capabilities like data backup and advanced analytics.\n\nWhat makes IRIS 2.0 unique is its strong focus on affordability, inclusivity, and reliability. While global assistive devices cost several lakhs and rely heavily on internet connectivity, IRIS 2.0 is designed to be priced around ₹25,000–₹30,000, with optional subscription-based premium features, making it accessible to a much larger population through direct sales, NGO partnerships, CSR programs, and government initiatives. \nIn essence, IRIS 2.0 is not just a product but a social-impact driven startup idea that combines AI innovation with inclusive design, aiming to transform assistive healthcare technology and significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people.",

      "aboutStartup": "'NIRYAT AARAMBH' is an export enablement Initiative designed to convert ODOP-based farmers, artisans, and small manufacturers of Madhya Pradesh into \"First-time Exporters\" by addressing the two most critical barriers to entering international trade —  The risk of losing fees spent on export training and lack of access to the first international buyer.\nThe foundation of NIRYAT AARAMBH is a risk-free, escrow-based fee structure for producers, where facilitation charges are securely held and released only upon completion of defined first-export milestones. This ensures that producers do not lose their fees if the first export does not materialise. Alongside this, NIRYAT AARAMBH takes responsibility for identifying and engaging the first international buyer, supported by end-to-end assistance in export documentation, certification facilitation, and process coordination required to complete the initial export transaction.\n\nOperating as a service-led export enabler and not as a trader, NIRYAT AARAMBH aligns with the One District One Product (ODOP) framework and aims to expand Madhya Pradesh’s grassroots participation in global trade through a structured and confident- first export experience.",

This causes heavy air pollution, loss of soil nutrients, and long-term damage to farmland.\n\nAgro-Cycle offers a simple on-field solution. It uses a tractor-mounted machine that crushes crop residue, mixes it into the soil, and applies beneficial microbes in one single pass. When water is added, these microbes break down the residue naturally and turn it into organic matter.\n\nInstead of burning waste, Agro-Cycle helps farmers convert stubble into soil nutrition, reduce fertilizer use, save time, and protect the environment. The idea is affordable, farmer-friendly, and designed especially for small and medium farmers.",

      "aboutStartup": "The increasing use of solar energy has made performance monitoring and efficiency optimization a critical requirement for both small and large solar installations. However, many solar power systems operate without continuous monitoring, making it difficult to identify performance losses caused by factors such as dust accumulation, shading, panel aging, temperature rise, inverter faults, or fluctuating weather conditions. In the absence of real-time data, users are often unaware of reduced efficiency, leading to energy losses, delayed maintenance, and lower financial returns.\n\nThe IoT-Based Solar Power Monitoring System is designed to provide complete real-time visibility of solar power generation and system health. The system continuously measures key electrical and environmental parameters including solar panel voltage, current, power output, total energy generation, panel temperature, and solar irradiance. By capturing these parameters in real time, the system enables accurate assessment of panel performance and overall system efficiency under varying environmental conditions.\n\nThe system uses IoT-enabled sensors and smart measurement units installed at the solar panels and inverter level. Voltage and current sensors measure electrical output, while irradiance sensors track the amount of sunlight falling on the panels. Temperature sensors monitor panel heating, which directly affects efficiency. All collected data is transmitted to a cloud-based platform, where it is processed and displayed through an easy-to-understand web or mobile dashboard. Users can view live generation data, daily and monthly energy reports, and performance trends without requiring technical expertise.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the system is its intelligent fault detection and alert mechanism. The system continuously compares real-time values of voltage, current, power, and irradiance with expected performance levels. Any abnormal behavior, such as sudden drops in power output despite high irradiance, unusual voltage or current fluctuations, inverter malfunction, or excessive temperature rise, is immediately detected. The user is notified in real time, allowing quick corrective action and reducing system downtime.\n\nBeyond monitoring, the system supports performance optimization and preventive maintenance. By analyzing historical data, the system helps identify underperforming panels, dust-related losses, seasonal efficiency variations, and long-term degradation trends. This enables informed maintenance scheduling, optimized cleaning cycles, and better planning for system upgrades. The system is designed to be scalable and can be implemented in residential rooftops, commercial buildings, institutions, and large solar plants.\n\nThe technology behind the IoT-Based Solar Power Monitoring System includes IoT sensors, real-time data acquisition modules, cloud-based analytics, and a secure monitoring interface. The architecture is cost-effective, reliable, and suitable for Indian climatic and operating conditions. Future enhancements include AI-based power prediction using irradiance data, weather-integrated energy forecasting, automated fault diagnosis, and integration with smart grids and energy management systems.\n\nThe vision of this system is to make solar power generation transparent, efficient, and reliable. By providing real-time insights into voltage, current, irradiance, temperature, power, and energy generation, the system empowers users to maximize solar output, reduce operational losses, and contribute effectively to a sustainable and clean energy ecosystem.",

      "aboutStartup": "SAOS – Smart Agriculture Optimization System\nSAOS (Smart Agriculture Optimization System) is an innovative agri-technology solution designed to modernize traditional farming through data-driven intelligence and smart decision-making. Agriculture today faces multiple challenges such as unpredictable climate conditions, inefficient water usage, increasing input costs, and limited access to real-time information. Most farmers still depend on experience-based farming practices, which often lead to excessive resource usage, crop stress, and reduced profitability. SAOS aims to solve these challenges by introducing a smart, reliable, and technology-driven system that enables farmers to take informed decisions at the right time.\nThe system works by continuously monitoring key environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and overall field conditions using sensors and data analytics. Based on this real-time data, SAOS provides intelligent recommendations for irrigation scheduling, crop health management, and resource optimization. This ensures that crops receive only the required amount of water and care, preventing both overuse and underuse of resources. As a result, farmers can achieve better yield with reduced operational costs.\nSAOS also includes a smart decision-support mechanism that analyzes historical and real-time data to detect abnormal patterns in crop growth and environmental conditions. It helps farmers identify early signs of crop stress and take preventive actions before major damage occurs. The system presents all insights through a simple and user-friendly dashboard, making it accessible even for farmers with limited technical knowledge. The platform is designed to be scalable, allowing it to be used by small farmers as well as large agricultural enterprises.\nThe technology behind SAOS combines IoT-based sensing, data analytics, and rule-based intelligence, with future scope for machine learning-based prediction models. It operates on a cloud-based infrastructure and can be accessed through a mobile or web interface, making monitoring and decision-making convenient and efficient. The system is specifically designed keeping Indian agricultural conditions in mind, ensuring affordability, reliability, and adaptability.\nOne of the key strengths of SAOS is its focus on optimization rather than just monitoring. It not only collects data but converts it into meaningful insights that help reduce water consumption, lower input costs, and increase overall productivity. By promoting efficient resource utilization, SAOS contributes to sustainable farming practices while improving farmers’ income and reducing the risk of crop failure.\nIn the long term, SAOS aims to integrate advanced features such as AI-based crop disease detection, weather-based forecasting, automated irrigation control, and multilingual mobile applications. It also holds potential for integration with government agricultural schemes and smart farming initiatives. The vision of SAOS is to transform traditional agriculture into a smart, sustainable, and profitable ecosystem by empowering farmers with technology-driven solutions.",

Patients with post-operative needs, neurological conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, or chronic pain often:\n\nLack access to trained physiotherapists\n\nDiscontinue therapy due to travel and cost constraints\n\nReceive unregulated or incorrectly administered treatment\n\nExperience delayed recovery, chronic pain, or long-term disability\n\nConventional physiotherapy is location-dependent, clinician-intensive, and difficult to scale, especially in regions with low provider density and fragmented follow-up care.\n\nThe Solution\n\nOur platform enables clinically supervised, device-driven rehabilitation at home, supported by a centralized CMS and an intelligent CDSS layer.\n\nWe combine connected therapeutic hardware with a secure, clinician-first software platform that allows qualified physiotherapists to remotely prescribe, control, and monitor treatments such as:\n\nTENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation)\n\nMuscle Stimulation\n\nIFT (Interferential Therapy)\n\nOther electrotherapy and rehabilitation protocols\n\nPatients receive therapy at home using our devices, while physiotherapists retain full clinical authority and visibility, ensuring safety, compliance, and therapeutic effectiveness.\n\nHow It Works\nIoT-Enabled Devices\n\nSmart electrotherapy devices capable of receiving real-time treatment parameters and enforcing clinician-defined safety thresholds.\n\nClinical Management System (CMS)\n\nA centralized system to manage:\n\nPatient profiles and rehabilitation cases\n\nDiagnosis, goals, and treatment plans\n\nSession history, progress tracking, and adherence\n\nDevice allocation and therapy timelines\n\nClinical Decision Support System (CDSS)\n\nAn intelligent decision-support layer that:\n\nAssists physiotherapists with protocol recommendations based on condition, progress, and clinical guidelines\n\nFlags deviations, risks, or non-compliance\n\nSupports evidence-based decision-making without removing clinician control\n\nClinician Dashboard\n\nPhysiotherapists can:\n\nConfigure therapy protocols\n\nAdjust intensity, duration, and frequency\n\nMonitor patient progress and outcomes remotely\n\nPatient Interface\n\nA simple, guided experience designed for:\n\nLow-tech environments\n\nElderly and mobility-restricted patients\n\nClear session guidance and compliance support\n\nReal-Time Monitoring & Oversight\n\nSession logs, device usage, and safety events are tracked continuously\n\nNo autonomous therapy—all treatments remain under professional supervision\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nExtends the reach of qualified physiotherapists without compromising clinical standards\n\nReduces travel burden, costs, and therapy dropout rates\n\nEnables continuity of care beyond hospitals and urban clinics\n\nImproves outcomes through consistent, protocol-driven rehabilitation\n\nScales physiotherapy access using clinician-led, technology-enabled care\n\nWho It Serves\n\nPatients in rural and semi-urban regions\n\nPost-operative and chronic rehabilitation patients\n\nElderly and mobility-restricted individuals\n\nHospitals and clinics extending care beyond physical facilities\n\nThe Advantage\n\nUnlike generic home-use therapy devices, our platform is clinician-controlled, CMS-driven, and CDSS-assisted.\n\nWe are not replacing physiotherapists.\nWe are amplifying their clinical reach, standardizing care delivery, and enabling safe, data-driven rehabilitation at scale—while remaining regulation-ready and clinically compliant.\n\nVision\n\nTo become the infrastructure layer for remote physical rehabilitation, combining connected devices, clinical workflows, and decision support, enabling millions of patients to receive safe, effective, and supervised physiotherapy—regardless of geography.",
